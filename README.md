## Installation and Setup
1. First, clone the repo. Then, we recommend creating a clean [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) environment, activating it and installing torch and torchvision, as follows:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/sha2nkt/deco.git
cd deco
conda create -n deco python=3.9 -y
conda activate deco
pip install torch==1.13.0+cu117 torchvision==0.14.0+cu117 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```
Please adjust the CUDA version as required.

2. Install PyTorch3D from source. Users may also refer to [PyTorch3D-install](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for more details.
However, our tests show that installing using ``conda`` sometimes runs into dependency conflicts.
Hence, users may alternatively install Pytorch3D from source following the steps below.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git
cd pytorch3d
pip install .
cd ..
```

3. Install the other dependancies and download the required data.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh fetch_data.sh
```

4. Please download [SMPL](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/) (version 1.1.0) and [SMPL-X](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/) (v1.1) files into the data folder. Please rename the SMPL files to ```SMPL_FEMALE.pkl```, ```SMPL_MALE.pkl``` and ```SMPL_NEUTRAL.pkl```. The directory structure for the ```data``` folder has been elaborated below:

```

├── smpl
│   ├── SMPL_FEMALE.pkl
│   ├── SMPL_MALE.pkl

### Download the DAMON dataset

⚠️ Register account on the [DECO website](https://deco.is.tue.mpg.de/register.php), and then use your username and password to login to the _Downloads_ page.

Follow the instructions on the _Downloads_ page to download the DAMON dataset. The provided metadata in the `npz` files is described as follows: 
- `imgname`: relative path to the image file
- `pose` : SMPL pose parameters inferred from [CLIFF](https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/CLIFF)
- `transl` : SMPL root translation inferred from [CLIFF](https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/CLIFF)
- `shape` : SMPL shape parameters inferred from [CLIFF](https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/CLIFF)
- `cam_k` : camera intrinsic matrix inferred from [CLIFF](https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/CLIFF)
- `polygon_2d_contact`: 2D contact annotation from [HOT](https://hot.is.tue.mpg.de/)
- `contact_label`: 3D contact annotations on the SMPL mesh
- `contact_label_smplx`: 3D contact annotation on the SMPL-X mesh
- `contact_label_objectwise`: 3D contact annotations split into separate object labels on the SMPL mesh
- `contact_label_smplx_objectwise`: 3D contact annotations split into separate object labels on the SMPL-X mesh
- `scene_seg`: path to the scene segmentation map from [Mask2Former](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mask2Former)
- `part_seg`: path to the body part segmentation map

The order of values is the same for all the keys.

#### Converting DAMON contact labels to SMPL-X format (and back)

To convert contact labels from SMPL to SMPL-X format and vice-versa, run the following command
```bash
python reformat_contacts.py \
    --contact_npz datasets/Release_Datasets/damon/hot_dca_trainval.npz \
    --input_type 'smpl'
```

## Run demo on images
The following command will run DECO on all images in the specified `--img_src`, and save rendering and colored mesh in `--out_dir`. The `--model_path` flag is used to specify the specific checkpoint being used. Additionally, the base mesh color and the color of predicted contact annotation can be specified using the `--mesh_colour` and `--annot_colour` flags respectively. 
```bash
python inference.py \
    --img_src example_images \
    --out_dir demo_out
```

## Training and Evaluation

We release 3 versions of the DECO model:
<ol>
    <li> DECO-HRNet (<em> Best performing model </em>) </li>
    <li> DECO-HRNet w/o context branches </li>
    <li> DECO-Swin </li>
</ol>

All the checkpoints have been downloaded to ```checkpoints```. 
However, please note that versions 2 and 3 have been trained solely on the RICH dataset. <br>
We recommend using the first DECO version.

Please download the actual DAMON dataset from the website and place it in ```datasets/Release_Datasets``` following the instructions given.

### Evaluation
To run evaluation on the DAMON dataset, please run the following command:

```bash
python tester.py --cfg configs/cfg_test.yml
```

### Training
The config provided (```cfg_train.yml```) is set to train and evaluate on all three datasets: DAMON, RICH and PROX. To change this, please change the value of the key ```TRAINING.DATASETS``` and ```VALIDATION.DATASETS``` in the config (please also change ```TRAINING.DATASET_MIX_PDF``` as required). <br>
Also, the best checkpoint is stored by default at ```checkpoints/Other_Checkpoints```.
Please run the following command to start training of the DECO model:

```bash
python train.py --cfg configs/cfg_train.yml
```

### Training on custom datasets

To train on other datasets, please follow these steps:
1. Please create an npz of the dataset, following the structure of the datasets in ```datasets/Release_Datasets``` with the corresponding keys and values.
2. Please create scene segmentation maps, if not available. We have used [Mask2Former](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mask2Former) in our work.
3. For creating the part segmentation maps, this [sample script](https://github.com/sha2nkt/deco/blob/main/utils/get_part_seg_mask.py) can be referred to.
4. Add the dataset name(s) to ```train.py``` ([these lines](https://github.com/sha2nkt/deco/blob/d5233ecfad1f51b71a50a78c0751420067e82c02/train.py#L83)), ```tester.py``` ([these lines](https://github.com/sha2nkt/deco/blob/d5233ecfad1f51b71a50a78c0751420067e82c02/tester.py#L51)) and ```data/mixed_dataset.py``` ([these lines](https://github.com/sha2nkt/deco/blob/d5233ecfad1f51b71a50a78c0751420067e82c02/data/mixed_dataset.py#L17)), according to the body model being used (SMPL/SMPL-X)
5. Add the path(s) to the dataset npz(s) to ```common/constants.py``` ([these lines](https://github.com/sha2nkt/deco/blob/d5233ecfad1f51b71a50a78c0751420067e82c02/common/constants.py#L19)).
6. Finally, change ```TRAINING.DATASETS``` and ```VALIDATION.DATASETS``` in the config file and you're good to go!


## Docker/Singularity Installation

The Images are available on DockerHub at: ```https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pscontainer/deco```.

### 1. Make the Singularity/Docker Environment:

You can launch with Singularity:
```
singularity build --sandbox /tmp/conda_sandbox docker://pscontainer/deco:cuda117
```

You can launch with Docker:
```
docker run --gpus all -it --rm pscontainer/deco:cuda117
```


### 2. Enter the Singularity Environment
```
singularity shell --writable --nv -f -c --pwd=/tmp/home -H /tmp/home /tmp/conda_sandbox/
```

In order to save the code and models downloaded, you can use the ```--writable-tmpfs``` and move to a path where the models persist out of a temporary folder.

```
singularity shell --writable-tmpfs --nv --pwd=/tmp/home -H /tmp/home /tmp/conda_sandbox/
```

With Docker:

```
docker run --gpus all -it --rm \
  -v deco_data:/persistent_data \
  -w /persistent_data \
  -e HOME=/persistent_data \
  pscontainer/deco:cuda117
```

### 3. Starting the download of all environment
```
git clone https://github.com/sha2nkt/deco.git
```

You need to register on "https://deco.is.tue.mpg.de/" to access the weights of the model, and on “https://hot.is.tue.mpg.de/" to have access to the data. 

You can now launch the starter script that will install all of the needed to launch deco on your device.
```bash
bash starter.sh
```


### 4. Launching the Model from the Apptainer Container
We must first leave the container.
``` exit ```


#### Make a .sif file

```
singularity build ./deco.sif /tmp/conda_sandbox/
```


You can verify that the installation was done correctly by launching the following script on the container. 
We make an output directory:
``` mkdir outputDECO```

You can verify that the installation was done correctly by launching the following script on the container.
we make the ```DecoLaunch.sh```

```bash
cd /path/to/deco

eval "$(conda shell.bash hook)"

conda activate deco

python inference.py \
    --img_src example_images \
    --out_dir /container/output/
```

### Run the demo on a video

```
singularity exec --bind ./outputDECO:/container/output deco.sif ./DecoLaunch.sh
```

### Important Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary GPU drivers and CUDA installed on your host system.
- The Docker version requires Docker with GPU support to be installed.
- The Singularity version requires Singularity to be installed on your system.
- Make sure to adjust paths and directories as needed for your specific setup.
